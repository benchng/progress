# Collected Questions

## Week 1

1. Rather a suggestion. Can't remember *grep* that much. Can we go over it tomorrow?
2. A overview of Bash and to what extend we should know it. 
3. How I know some of the resources online is based on Python2 or Python3? Sometimes it is not clarified, yet sometimes based on the date I know it can't be Python3. But sometimes it's confusing.
